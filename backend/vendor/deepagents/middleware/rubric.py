"""Rubric middleware for self-evaluated agent iteration.

`RubricMiddleware` lets a caller declare *what done looks like* via a
rubric. Each time the agent would otherwise finish — i.e. the model
returns a response with no further tool calls — the middleware invokes a
separate grader sub-agent against the transcript. If the grader returns
`needs_revision`, its feedback is injected as a `HumanMessage` and the
agent loop resumes. Grading repeats until the grader returns `satisfied`
or `failed`, or `max_iterations` is reached.

    The middleware activates only when a caller passes a `rubric` on

    return without modifying state, so the middleware is safe to include
    unconditionally in a `create_deep_agent` stack.

    !!! note "Observing non-satisfied terminations"
        When grading ends with `failed`, `max_iterations_reached`, or
        `grader_error`, the middleware does **not** mutate the response
        messages. The last `AIMessage` in the agent's output is whatever
        the model produced just before the grader gave up. Callers who
        need to branch on non-satisfied termination must inspect one of:

        - `_rubric_status` on the returned state (or `agent.get_state(...)`
          on a checkpointed thread),
        - the `on_evaluation` callback,
        - the `rubric_evaluation_end` stream event.

        A `logger.warning` is also emitted when `max_iterations_reached`
        fires.

    Args:
        model: Model used by the grader sub-agent. Accepts either a model
            string like `"provider:model-id"` or a `BaseChatModel`
            instance.
        system_prompt: Custom grading instructions; falls back to the
            built-in grader prompt when not set.
        tools: Tools the grader may call before producing its
            `GraderResponse`. With none, the grader reasons from the
            transcript alone.
        max_iterations: Hard cap on grader iterations per rubric attempt;
            hard-capped at 20. When the cap is reached without a
            `satisfied` verdict, the agent terminates with status
            `'max_iterations_reached'` (see the note above on how to
            observe this).
        on_evaluation: Optional callback one can invoke with each `RubricEvaluation` after
            grading. Exceptions raised by the callback are logged at
            error level and suppressed; do not use this callback to
            enforce control flow.
