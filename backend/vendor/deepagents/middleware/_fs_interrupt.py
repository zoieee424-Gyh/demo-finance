"""Glue between `FilesystemPermission` rules and `HumanInTheLoopMiddleware`.

`FilesystemMiddleware` itself doesn't know about HITL — it only enforces deny
rules and filters denied results. The graph-assembly code in
`deepagents.graph` calls `_build_interrupt_on_from_permissions` to turn the
filesystem permissions into an `interrupt_on` mapping for
`HumanInTheLoopMiddleware`, using a `when` predicate that decides per call
whether the access intersects an interrupt-mode rule.

#   - "bulk":  the call's path argument names a search root and the call may
#     surface any descendant (ls, glob, grep). Interrupt fires whenever the
#     search subtree intersects an interrupt-mode rule's pattern, and — when
#     the path argument is omitted (`grep(path=None)`) — fires unconditionally
#     for any interrupt-mode rule, because a pathless bulk call can touch
