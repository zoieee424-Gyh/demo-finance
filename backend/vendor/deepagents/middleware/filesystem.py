This is useful for exploring the filesystem and finding the right file to read or edit.

READ_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Reads a file from the filesystem.

Assume this tool is able to read all files. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- By default, it reads up to 100 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- **IMPORTANT for large files and codebase exploration**: Use pagination with offset and limit parameters to avoid context overflow
    - First scan: read_file(file_path="...", limit=100) to see file structure
    - Read more sections: read_file(file_path="...", offset=100, limit=200) for next 200 lines
    - Only omit limit (read full file) when necessary for editing
- Specify offset and limit: read_file(file_path="...", offset=0, limit=100) reads first 100 lines
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- Lines longer than 5,000 characters will be split into multiple lines with continuation markers (e.g., 5.1, 5.2, etc.). `limit` applies to source lines, so continuation rows do not consume the budget.
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
- Image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, etc.), audio and video files, and PDFs are returned as multimodal content blocks (see https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/messages#multimodal).

For multimodal reads (image, audio, video, PDF, etc.):
- Use `read_file(file_path=...)`
- Do NOT use `offset`/`limit` for images (pagination is text-only)
- If file details were compacted from history, call `read_file` again on the same path

- You should ALWAYS make sure a file has been read before editing it."""

EDIT_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must read the file before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file first.
- When editing, preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) from the read output. Never include line number prefixes in old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it."""

- `*.txt` - Find all text files in the backend's default root

- Show matching lines: `grep(pattern="error", output_mode="content")`
- Search for code with special chars: `grep(pattern="def __init__(self):")`"""

EXECUTE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Executes a shell command in an isolated sandbox environment.

Usage:
Executes a given command in the sandbox environment with proper handling and security measures.
Before executing the command, please follow these steps:
1. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the ls tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use ls to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory
2. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd "path with spaces/file.txt")
   - Examples of proper quoting:
     - cd "/Users/name/My Documents" (correct)
     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)
     - python "/path/with spaces/script.py" (correct)
     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)
   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command
   - Capture the output of the command
Usage notes:
  - Commands run in an isolated sandbox environment
  - Returns combined stdout/stderr output with exit code
  - If the output is very large, it may be truncated
  - For long-running commands, use the optional timeout parameter to override the default timeout (e.g., execute(command="make build", timeout=300))
  - A timeout of 0 may disable timeouts on backends that support no-timeout execution
  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like find and grep. Instead use the grep, glob tools to search. You MUST avoid read tools like cat, head, tail, and use read_file to read files.
  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings)
    - Use '&&' when commands depend on each other (e.g., "mkdir dir && cd dir")
    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail
  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of cd

Examples:
  Good examples:
    - execute(command="pytest /foo/bar/tests")
    - execute(command="python /path/to/script.py")
    - execute(command="npm install && npm test")
    - execute(command="make build", timeout=300)

  Bad examples (avoid these):
    - execute(command="cd /foo/bar && pytest tests")  # Use absolute path instead
    - execute(command="cat file.txt")  # Use read_file tool instead
    - execute(command="find . -name '*.py'")  # Use glob tool instead
    - execute(command="grep -r 'pattern' .")  # Use grep tool instead

Note: This tool is only available if the backend supports execution (SandboxBackendProtocol).
If execution is not supported, the tool will return an error message."""

# Tools that should be excluded from the large result eviction logic.
#
# This tuple contains tools that should NOT have their results evicted to the filesystem
# when they exceed token limits. Tools are excluded for different reasons:
#
# 1. Tools with built-in truncation (ls, glob, grep):
#    These tools truncate their own output when it becomes too large. When these tools
#    produce truncated output due to many matches, it typically indicates the query
#    needs refinement rather than full result preservation. In such cases, the truncated
#    matches are potentially more like noise and the LLM should be prompted to narrow
#    its search criteria instead.
#
# 2. Tools with problematic truncation behavior (read_file):
#    read_file is tricky to handle as the failure mode here is single long lines
#    (e.g., imagine a jsonl file with very long payloads on each line). If we try to
#    truncate the result of read_file, the agent may then attempt to re-read the
#    truncated file using read_file again, which won't help.
#
# 3. Tools that never exceed limits (edit_file, write_file):
#    These tools return minimal confirmation messages and are never expected to produce
#    output large enough to exceed token limits, so checking them would be unnecessary.

class FilesystemMiddleware(AgentMiddleware[FilesystemState, ContextT, ResponseT]):
    """Middleware for providing filesystem and optional execution tools to an agent.

    This middleware adds filesystem tools to the agent: `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`,
    `edit_file`, `glob`, and `grep`.

    Files can be stored using any backend that implements the
    [`BackendProtocol`][deepagents.backends.protocol.BackendProtocol].

    If the backend implements
    [`SandboxBackendProtocol`][deepagents.backends.protocol.SandboxBackendProtocol],
    an `execute` tool is also added for running shell commands.

    This middleware also automatically evicts large tool results to the file system when
    they exceed a token threshold, preventing context window saturation.

    Args:
        backend: Backend for file storage and optional execution.

            If not provided, defaults to
            [`StateBackend`][deepagents.backends.state.StateBackend]
            (ephemeral storage in agent state).

            For persistent storage or hybrid setups, use
            [`CompositeBackend`][deepagents.backends.composite.CompositeBackend]
            with custom routes.

            For execution support, use a backend that implements
            [`SandboxBackendProtocol`][deepagents.backends.protocol.SandboxBackendProtocol].
        system_prompt: Optional custom system prompt override.
        custom_tool_descriptions: Optional custom tool descriptions override.
        tool_token_limit_before_evict: Token limit before evicting a tool result to the
            filesystem.

            When exceeded, writes the result using the configured backend and replaces it
            with a truncated preview and file reference.

    Example:
        ```python
        from deepagents.middleware.filesystem import FilesystemMiddleware
        from deepagents.backends import StateBackend, StoreBackend, CompositeBackend
        from langchain.agents import create_agent

        # Ephemeral storage only (default, no execution)
        agent = create_agent(middleware=[FilesystemMiddleware()])

        # With hybrid storage (ephemeral + persistent /memories/)
        backend = CompositeBackend(default=StateBackend(), routes={"/memories/": StoreBackend()})
        agent = create_agent(middleware=[FilesystemMiddleware(backend=backend)])

        # With sandbox backend (supports execution)
        from my_sandbox import DockerSandboxBackend

        sandbox = DockerSandboxBackend(container_id="my-container")
        agent = create_agent(middleware=[FilesystemMiddleware(backend=sandbox)])
